A simple step on how to make 2 LEDs blinking with certain ON and OFF time.

The LED 1 (PB0 - pin8) needs to be flashing with ON time 750 ms and OFF time 350 ms.
The LED 2 (PB1 - pin9) needs to be flashing with ON time 400 and OFF time 600 ms.

Parts needed:

1x Arduino UNO (different Arduino has different pins function)
1x Breadboard
2x LEDs
2x Resistors (1k)
